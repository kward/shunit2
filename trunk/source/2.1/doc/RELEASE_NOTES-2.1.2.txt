Release Notes for shUnit2 2.1.2
===============================

This release adds initial support for the zsh shell. Due to some differences
with this shell as compared with others, some special checks have been added,
and there are some extra requirements necessary when this shell is to be used.

To use zsh with shUnit2, the following two requirements must be met:
* To match behavior with other shells, the shwordsplit option must be set. When
  invoking zsh from either the command-line or via script, make sure to add the
  '-y' option.
* shUnit2 needs the name of the unit test script so that it can glean the
  test function names automatically. zsh does not pass the $0 variable through
  to a sourced library (it replaces it with the name of the library) so a
  separate variable must be used so that shUnit2 has the name of the parent
  script from which test functions will be found. Change the shUnit2 call line
  in the unit test if zsh support is needed. ::

    SHUNIT_PARENT=$0 . /path/to/shunit2
